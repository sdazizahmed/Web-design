          <h2>History of Photography</h2>
          <img src="images/history.jpeg" alt="Old Camera" class="float-left" />
          <p>
            Photography was first invented in the early 19th century. The very
            first photographs were black and white and required long exposure
            times. Over the years, technology improved, leading to film cameras
            and later digital cameras. Photography has not only captured history
            but also shaped the way humans tell stories.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first permanent photograph was captured in 1826 by Joseph
            Nicéphore Niépce using a process called heliography. This
            breakthrough paved the way for further developments by Louis
            Daguerre and William Henry Fox Talbot, who created more practical
            photographic processes in the 1830s.
          </p>
          <p>
            The invention of roll film by George Eastman in the 1880s made
            photography accessible to amateurs, leading to the creation of the
            Kodak company. The 20th century saw rapid advancements with 35mm
            cameras, color film, and eventually the digital revolution that
            transformed photography into the ubiquitous medium it is today.

            Today, photography is a creative art form used by both professionals
            and hobbyists. Portrait photography focuses on people and emotions,
            while landscape photography captures the beauty of nature. Street
            photography documents daily life, and macro photography allows us to
            explore small details like flowers and insects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other popular styles include architectural photography, which
            highlights the design and structure of buildings; wildlife
            photography, which requires patience and skill to capture animals in
            their natural habitats; and documentary photography, which tells
            stories about real-life situations and events.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each style offers a different way of looking at the world, making
            photography a versatile and exciting field. With the advent of new
            technologies like drone photography and computational photography,
            the possibilities continue to expand, offering fresh perspectives
            and creative opportunities for photographers of all levels.

            If you are new to photography, start simple. Use natural light
            whenever possible and avoid using flash indoors. Learn the rule of
            thirds to improve composition, and keep your hands steady or use a
            tripod to avoid blurry photos.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most importantly, practice often. Take pictures every day,
            experiment with angles and lighting, and review your results to see
            how you can improve. The best way to learn photography is by doing
            it!

              <h3>Master Composition</h3>
              <p>
                Learn about leading lines, framing, and the rule of thirds to
                create visually appealing images.

              <h3>Understand Lighting</h3>
              <p>
                Golden hour (just after sunrise or before sunset) provides the
                most flattering natural light.

              <h3>Experiment with Settings</h3>

                Try shooting in manual mode to understand how aperture, shutter
                speed, and ISO work together.
